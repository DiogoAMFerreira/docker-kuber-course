# Build image

```sh
docker build -t node-dep-example .
```

# Run container

```sh
docker run -d --rm --name node-dep -p 80:80 node-dep-example
```

# Connect to AWS server
```sh
ssh -i "example-1.pem" ec2-user@ec2-18-218-126-91.us-est-2.compute.azonaws.com

# Important: Installing Docker on a Virtual Machine

Install Docker on a virtual EC2 instance.

Please note that the following command (which is used in the next lecture) will unfortunately not work anymore:

```sh
    amazon-linux-extras install docker
```

Instead, use this approach / these commands:

```sh
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum -y install docker
     
    sudo service docker start
     
    sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

Make sure to log out + back in after running these commands.

Once you logged back in, run this command:
```sh
    sudo systemctl enable docker
```
Thereafter, you can check whether Docker is available by running:

```sh
    docker version
```

Of course you might not always want to install it on a AWS EC2 instance though - maybe you are using a different provider.

In that case, you can always follow the Linux setup instructions you find on the official Docker page: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ (under "Server").
